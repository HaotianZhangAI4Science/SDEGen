# SDEGen
This is the official SDEGen model, the more detailed description and how to train the model on your own dataset is coming soon! 
By the way, a portion of code is based on the ConfGF, please consider checking their work if you're interested in the Molecular Conformation Generation Problem. 
By by the way, recently, I have noticed some people confused the molecular conformation generation and molecular generation, while the former refers to learning P(R|G), the latter is related to learn P(G).
Please be careful when conducting researches! Don't be the man that 'have no views of one's ownï¼Œrepeat what other says'.
