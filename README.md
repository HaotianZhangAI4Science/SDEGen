By the way, a portion of the code is based on [ConfGF](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/ConfGF), please consider checking their work if you're interested in the Molecular Conformation Generation Problem. 

By by the way, recently, I have noticed some people confused the molecular conformation generation and molecular generation, while the former refers to learning P(R|G), the latter is related to learning P(G).
Please be careful when conducting research! Don't be the man that 'have no views of one's own, repeat what other says'.
